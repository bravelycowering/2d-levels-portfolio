				<blockquote>
					90 Degrees is a 2D precision platformer I created many years ago.
					You can use arrow keys to move around, jump with Space or C, and pause with Escape.
					Additionally, all controls can be rebound in the settings menu.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote><i>
					Exporting this one to work in web browsers was a lot tougher than I initially expected!
					The specific framework I'm using had some weirdly specific issues with the filesystem and audio modules
					in HTML5, so in-game level music has been disabled. Additionally, it may be extremely laggy. Here be dragons!

		<blockquote>To forcibly unlock all the levels, go to the main menu and type "colours", then press the button labeled "ULOCK" on the debug screen that appears.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>To open the debug console, press the ~ key on your keyboard. You can type the word "god" and hit enter to toggle invulnerability, and you can type "fly" and press enter to toggle flying, which should allow you to fly around and see all the levels.</blockquote>

		<h2>Level design process</h2>
		<p>
			This was one of the first fully featured games I had created, and one of the only ones I've completed, so
			I was extra careful to try and design well thought-out levels with a decent difficulty curve. The game starts
			with a very short hidden "tutorial" spanning roughly 6 levels, with the purpose of
			getting the player familiar with the game's physics, along with some core mechanics like orange
			lava that kills you, or light gray platforms you can jump through.
		</p>
		<p>
			For each gimmick the game introduces, there are five levels to accompany it. The first
			level teaches the player what the gimmick is and how to use it by isolating it in a fairly
			easy room. This way the player could experiment with the new object to learn about it in
			a mostly consequence-free environment. At the time I quite disliked games that would
			handhold the player throughout the entire experience, so my main goal with this was to teach the new
			mechanic without placing text or an arrow that simply told you how to use it. Additionally, each
			of these rooms were designed in a way that the player would not be able to complete it until
			they used the gimmick in the intended manner. Next there are three
			levels that give the player some practice with the new mechanic, each steadily increasing in difficulty
			and sometimes introducing new ways to use the mechanic. Lastly, there's one level that serves to test
			the player on how well they understand the mechanic.
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn't strictly adhere to this formula for every gimmick; the spring gets 2 learning rooms and
			they share space with the end of the hidden tutorial. The gravity field's learning room tries to
			catch you off-guard, instead giving you space at the start of the next room to get a feel for
			reverse gravity. But for every new gimmick that was introduced, I gave them all a dedicated space
			for the player to experiment and learn how it works before thrusting them into more challenging levels.
			The game ends with a room dedicated to refreshing the player on the various gimmicks they've encountered
			so far, a challenge room utilizing all of them, a long ominous hallway with no music (just for fun),
			and finally a huge room combining everything the player has learned through the game.
		</p>
		<h2>What I learned</h2>
		<p>
			I had multiple rounds of playtesting with multiple of my friends and through a discord server
			I ran online, which helped me tweak various aspects of the levels that were overly hard or easy.
			This also helped me realize that it's very hard to playtest something yourself when you already
			know the solution. There would be times where I thought of a <i>really cool jump</i>, but when
			playtested people would report that the level had an inconsistant difficulty as a result. This
			project greatly helped me refine my skills as a game developer and level designer.
