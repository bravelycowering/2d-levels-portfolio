		<h1>Celeste: Theo's Return</h1>
		<blockquote>
			Celeste: Theo's Return is a Celeste fangame that I helped create levels
			and music for. You can use arrow keys to move around, jump with Z, and
			climb with X. (If the game asks for an O or X button, those are
			the Z and X keys on your keyboard.)

			There are no debug controls in this game for skipping around and previewing levels.

		<h2>Level design challenges</h2>
		<p>
			I designed these levels with a much easier difficulty than I normally do for my personal
			projects. The developer had self-imposed a deadline of April 1st, which meant I had to design
			these levels and write all the music in a little less than a week. This game was created in
			<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank">PICO-8</a>, which restricts
			the screen size to 128x128 pixels. Since the developer had not programmed in any screen
			scrolling, I had a level size of 16x16 tiles to work with. I tried to design these levels
			similarly to how <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>'s levels were designed,
			given the nature of this project.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can't speak much on the development side of things since I wasn't involved in writing
			any of the code for this project.
