		<h1>Timeloss</h1>
		<blockquote>
			Timeloss is a (currently unfinished) arcade-style 2D platformer I'm currently working on.
			You can use arrow keys to move around and jump with Z, X, or the up arrow. (If the game
			asks for an O or X button, those are the Z and X keys on your keyboard.)

		<blockquote>
			The game will load with debug tools enabled the first time you hit play.
			You can press Q (to move backwards) and E (to move forwards) through levels
			sequentially. The game's levels are segmented into "worlds" containing 16
			levels each. You can press a number 1-8 to warp to the start of that world.
			Currently all of world 1 and levels 1 to 10 of world 2 are considered "finished."

		<h2>Level design challenges</h2>
		<p>
			The goal is to complete as many levels as possible before your timer runs out. Collecting
			100 coins gives you another minute of time. So, one challenge in making levels for this
			game has been balancing the number of coins you collect so you still feel a sense of
			urgency, without making it too hard to gather enough coins to keep playing. The first
			world is meant to serve as a sort of hidden "tutorial" to the game's core mechanics,
			with a notable increase in difficulty starting in world 2 and continuing throughout
			the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've written the game for <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank">PICO-8</a>,
			which restricts the screen size to 128x128 pixels. The game's levels have been restricted
			to the size of the screen. Additionally, each level's starting point (with the exception
			of the first level in a world) must be the same position on-screen as the previous level's
			exit point. This was done so that you don't need to search for where the player spawns
			each time you enter a new level. Since each level is timed, spawning in the same point
			as the previous exit facilitates a smooth transition for the player and greater efficiency
			in moving through the levels, maintaining the flow of gameplay. Combining that with the
			limited level size created a very fun and unique challenge when making levels for this game.
		</p>
		<h2>Development challenges</h2>
		<p>
			PICO-8 has a lot of arbitrary limitations which have required me to find workarounds as
			I've been developing this game. There's limited space in ROM for music storage, only enough
			for two of the songs I wrote for the game. So, to overcome this issue and "create" more
			space for music, I wrote some code that lets me pack and unpack music data from the section
			of ROM that stores sprites. (You play as a square, so it's not like I was using that space
			for anything.) Since rendering actual 3D in the background would take away too much CPU
			time from the gameplay, I don't. Instead, I faked it using a few points rotating in an oval
			pattern and then connecting them with lines. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At one point during development, the debug tools I had created were causing the game to
			exceed PICO-8's limit on code size. Since I wasn't planning on shipping the debug tools
			with the final game, I wrote a bytecode interpreter that used as few lines of code as
			possible. I then rewrote the debug tools in that bytecode format using a custom assembler
			I created. I've learned so much just from working on this one project.
